# TodoApp Functionality
In this To-do App you can add new todos/remove todos .
I have used Local storage of browser to store the data so it can stay there for further use.
I have used array filtering to display the data on the basis of search text.
With checkbox you can filter out incompleted todos.
With checkbox you can mark the completed todos.

Todo App Code
I have used Array methods(find, findIndex, Splice, filter,forEach) to save/delete/filter todos.
Arrow Function have been used.
Contitional/Ternary Operators.
Complex DOM rendering to create/select elements,classes,event handeling and appending to parent elements.
uuidv4() has been to generate and give unique id to every Todo so they can be accessed easily.
